# Strategic Imperatives AI - Architecture Analysis

## Overview

The Strategic Imperatives AI is a sophisticated LangGraph-based workflow system designed to generate strategic analysis and presentations. The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation between foundation capabilities and workflow-specific implementations, integrating various AI models through SAP AI Core.

## System Architecture

### 1. Core Components

#### Backend (Python/Quart)
The backend is built using the Quart framework, an ASGI-based web application framework, providing asynchronous handling of requests. The backend is organized into several distinct layers:

- **Core Layer**: Contains the LangGraph workflow orchestration, state management, and event system
- **Modules Layer**: Provides reusable components and workflow-specific implementations
- **API Layer**: Exposes HTTP endpoints for client interaction

#### Frontend (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
The frontend uses a modern responsive design with WebSocket-based real-time communication:

- **UI Components**: Dynamic interface showing workflow progress
- **Event Display**: Real-time tracking of workflow stages
- **WebSocket Client**: Maintains a connection to receive updates from the backend

#### Integration Layer
- **SAP AI Core Integration**: Authentication and inference with AI models (Gemini Pro, GPT-4o, Claude)
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search capabilities for retrieving knowledge
- **Event Bus**: Real-time communication between components

### 2. Workflow Architecture

The system uses LangGraph, a directed graph framework for orchestrating language model workflows, with the following components:

- **State Graph**: Defines the sequence of operations and decision points
- **Nodes**: Represent specific workflow steps (industry classification, strategic priority analysis, etc.)
- **Edges**: Define the transitions between nodes
- **State Management**: Tracks the workflow state between steps

### 3. Communication Flow

1. **HTTP API Layer**: Handles initial requests and authentication
2. **WebSocket Events**: Real-time bi-directional communication
3. **Event Bus**: Internal publish-subscribe pattern for component communication
4. **Event Emitter**: Structured event generation for workflow tracking
5. **Event Adapters**: Connect the event system to logging and WebSocket

## Key Subsystems

### 1. LangGraph Workflow Engine

The core of the application is the LangGraph-based workflow engine, which orchestrates the analysis pipeline:

```
StateGraph(WorkflowState)
  ↓
  ├── Initialization
  ├── Industry Classification
  ├── Strategic Priority Analysis
  ├── CXO Identification
  ├── CXO Objectives Analysis
  ├── CXO Pain Points Analysis
  └── Presentation Generation
```

Each node in the graph is an async function that:
- Processes the current state
- Executes business logic via modules
- Updates the state
- Makes a routing decision
- Emits events for progress tracking

### 2. Event System

The event system follows a publish-subscribe pattern:

- **EventBus**: Central hub for event distribution 
- **WorkflowEventEmitter**: Structured event generation
- **Adapters**: Connect events to logging, WebSockets, and UI
- **Event Types**: Structured event types for different workflow activities

Events have importance levels (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW) for prioritization and filtering in the UI.

### 3. Foundation Modules

Reusable components providing core capabilities:

- **AI Core Integration**: Authentication and inference with AI models
- **Vector Search**: Semantic search across knowledge bases
- **Web Research**: Automated web scraping and content processing
- **Logging**: Structured logging system

### 4. Workflow-Specific Modules

1. **Industry Classification**
   - Industry classifier
   - Web search fallback
   - Confidence scoring

2. **Strategic Priority Analysis**

   - Role normalization

4. **CXO Objectives Analysis**

   - Strategic alignment assessment
   - Confidence scoring

5. **CXO Pain Points Analysis**
   - Pain points vectorization
   - Relevance matching
   - Industry-specific filtering

### 5. Vector Store Operations

The system uses vector embeddings for semantic search with the following collections:

1. **Pain Points Collection**
   - Industry-specific pain points
   - Role-based filtering

2. **E2E Processes Collection**
   - Process and sub-process descriptions
   - Industry metadata

3. **Solution Capabilities Collection**
   - Product capabilities
   - Value proposition mapping

### 6. Presentation Generation

The system generates PowerPoint presentations based on the analysis results:

- **Template System**: Pre-defined slide templates
- **Content Mapping**: Data-to-template mapping
- **Dynamic Generation**: Automated content placement
